# owtf-crawljax

This integrates [Crawljax](https://github.com/crawljax/crawljax) into OWTF to add functionality to scan AJAX rich targets.
This was done using the OWASP Summer Code Sprint (OSCS).

## Requirements

You need atleast JRE 7 (openjdk 7) installed for this plugin to work.

## Usage

Add your target in the `config.json` and modify the default click elements if you want. Some default values have been provide for reference.
Change as you wish :)

Run as `java -jar owtf_crawljax.jar`
